## Top 10 Most Relevant Papers

> **Context**: This section highlights the 10 papers most directly relevant to understanding SpecGD as *steepest descent in the spectral norm*, deriving norm-smoothness-based convergence bounds, and establishing "when SpecGD beats GD" criteria in terms of effective rank/singular-value spread. These papers also emphasize rotational invariance as the key geometric distinction from SignSGD.

<details>
<summary><b>1. When do spectral gradient updates help in deep learning?</b> — <i>Davis & Drusvyatskiy (2025)</i></summary>

[Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04299)

**Why it's central**: This paper provides the "missing empirical and theory bridge" for the **SpecGD>GD** condition. It gives a clean *layerwise* criterion comparing a **gradient nuclear-to-Frobenius ratio** ("nuclear rank") to **stable rank of activations**, and validates the low-stable-rank / high-nuclear-rank story on NanoGPT-scale training.

**Critical insights**:
- Their core condition is *still* largely a **one-step guarantee**; it explains *when a spectral step is locally better*, not full training dynamics or final generalization.
- **Also**: They focus on the **canonical spectral update (polar factor)**; practical Muon details (momentum, approximations, layerwise scaling tricks) are treated as motivation rather than fully analyzed.
- **How it plugs in**: The smoothness-ratio term ($L_2/L_{\text{spec}}$) can be made *concrete* for linear layers via their ($|A|_{\text{op}}^2$) vs ($|A|_F^2$) factors, which is where stable rank naturally appears.

<summary><b>2. The Geometry of Sign Gradient Descent</b> — <i>Balles, Pedregosa, Le Roux (2020)</i></summary>

[Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08056)

**Why it's central**: This paper explicitly builds the framework for **steepest descent under a norm**, norm-smoothness, and "geometry determines when SignGD beats GD." It isolates why sign methods can be good *when the Hessian is diagonally concentrated and highly anisotropic*—a fundamentally **coordinate-dependent** condition, which motivates the rotational-invariance pitch for spectral geometry.

**Critical insights**:
- **Key takeaway for rotation experiment**: They isolate why sign methods can be good *when the Hessian is diagonally concentrated and highly anisotropic*—a fundamentally **coordinate-dependent** condition, which motivates the rotational-invariance pitch for spectral geometry.
- **Limitation to flag**: Their "good regime" relies on **axis alignment** (via $\ell_\infty$-smoothness / diagonal structure). This is the right foil for the "spectral geometry is rotation invariant" claim, but it also means one should be careful not to claim that *any* non-Euclidean geometry is automatically "better"—it depends on *matching the right invariances*.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>3. How Muon's Spectral Design Benefits Generalization: A Study on Imbalanced Data</b> — <i>Vasudeva et al. (2025)</i></summary>

[Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22980)

**Why it's central**: They explicitly define/analyze the **canonical SpecGD update** (polar factor / truncated SVD style) and give a mechanistic story: **GD learns principal components sequentially, SpecGD learns them more uniformly**, which is extremely aligned with the "high effective rank / flat spectrum helps" narrative.

**Critical insights**:
- **Strength**: It gives a *clean toy-model* justification for the effective-rank criterion, and a bridge to "why this might matter for generalization," not just training loss.
- **Caveat**: The strongest theory is in stylized settings (Gaussian mixture + linear/bilinear/deep linear). The mechanism may not transfer unchanged to transformers; treat it as *evidence for plausibility*, not proof for LLMs.
- **Actionable for experiments**: It suggests measuring *component-wise learning rates* / spectral bias effects, not only raw loss decrease.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>4. Preconditioned Spectral Descent for Deep Learning</b> — <i>Carlson et al. (NeurIPS 2015)</i></summary>

[Paper Link](https://papers.neurips.cc/paper/2015/hash/8e6b42f1644ecb1327dc03ab345e618b-Abstract.html)

**Why it's central**: This is the "classical" deep-learning origin of **spectral (Schatten-$\infty$) steepest descent / SSD-style updates**, predating Muon. It already argues that non-Euclidean norms (including spectral) can give tighter progress bounds than Frobenius in certain models.

**Critical insights**:
- **Why it matters**: It's the strongest prior art to cite when claiming "spectral-norm geometry as a first-class optimizer design choice."
- **Limitation**: Their setting and derivations were motivated by particular model classes (e.g., earlier deep probabilistic models) and rely on **majorization-style bounds** that don't automatically generalize to modern architectures; the contribution is partly to generalize the geometry cleanly.
- **Practical note**: They also foreground the **computational bottleneck** of spectral steps (SVD-ish), which should be acknowledged when discussing "real Muon vs ideal SpecGD."

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>5. Old Optimizer, New Norm: An Anthology</b> — <i>Bernstein & Newhouse (2024)</i></summary>

[Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20325)

**Why it's central**: It's a high-level but influential framing: many optimizers can be viewed as **steepest descent under some norm** once you "switch off" certain moving averages. It specifically popularized the "Shampoo ↔ spectral descent" connection that helped revive interest in Muon-like spectral updates.

**Critical insights**:
- **Strength**: Great for "Related Work / Motivation" because it legitimizes the whole *norm geometry* design space and ties Muon to modern optimizer practice.
- **But**: It is partly a **perspective / unification** paper. Some equivalences depend on idealizations (e.g., disabling accumulations), so treat it as framing rather than the *core theoretical foundation* for convergence claims.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>6. Understanding Gradient Orthogonalization for Deep Learning via Non-Euclidean Trust-Region Optimization</b> — <i>Kovalev (2025)</i></summary>

[Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12645)

**Why it's central**: This is one of the cleanest "math-first" explanations of **Muon-style orthogonalized gradients**: it interprets orthogonalization as a **trust-region method in spectral norm**, and develops stochastic non-Euclidean trust-region theory with momentum that recovers Muon as a special case.

**Critical insights**:
- **Why it complements the proposal**: The proposal is steepest-descent geometry; Kovalev gives a *different but compatible* geometric lens (trust region) that helps justify "why orthogonalization is principled."
- **Watch-out**: Trust-region analyses can yield bounds that are conservative in deep learning regimes; don't oversell quantitative tightness. But it's excellent for "Muon is not a hack; it's a non-Euclidean method."

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>7. Muon Optimizes Under Spectral Norm Constraints</b> — <i>Chen, Li, Liu (2025)</i></summary>

[Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15054)

**Why it's central**: It formalizes Muon within the **Lion-$\mathcal{K}$** family and argues Muon + decoupled weight decay implicitly solves a **spectral norm constrained** problem; i.e., it gives a theory story for **implicit regularization** tied exactly to spectral norms.

**Critical insights**:
- **Strength**: This is the cleanest citation for any claim like "Muon has an implicit spectral-norm control / constraint viewpoint."
- **Limitation relative to the draft**: It's more about **implicit bias/regularization** than the progress-per-step / smoothness ratio story. So cite it to motivate why spectral geometry might change *which solution* you converge to—not just how fast.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>8. On the Convergence Analysis of Muon</b> — <i>Shen et al. (2025)</i></summary>

[Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23737)

**Why it's central**: It's a dedicated Muon convergence analysis and explicitly tries to characterize **when Muon can outperform GD**, relating the rate to Hessian structure (e.g., low-rank/block structure phenomena).

**Critical insights**:
- **Strength**: Provides a "Muon vs GD" theory baseline to compare against and cite to show the work is part of a rapidly evolving theory effort.
- **But**: Be careful aligning assumptions: many Muon analyses depend on structural Hessian properties or specific smoothness assumptions that may not match the norm-smoothness setup one-for-one.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>9. Training Deep Learning Models with Norm-Constrained LMOs</b> — <i>Pethick et al. (2025)</i></summary>

[Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07529)

**Why it's central**: It unifies several methods (including SignSGD and Muon) through **linear minimization oracles over norm balls** (conditional-gradient style), argues these can be used even for unconstrained problems, and explicitly frames Muon as operating on a **spectral-norm ball**.

**Critical insights**:
- **Value**: It gives an alternate unifying language (LMO/CG) that may strengthen the "normed-space optimization" positioning.
- **Mismatch to watch**: Their algorithmic family is not identical to *steepest descent*; it's easy to conflate the two. Cite it as "another unifying norm viewpoint," not as the source of the SpecGD convergence proof.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>10. signSGD: Compressed Optimisation for Non-Convex Problems</b> — <i>Bernstein et al. (2018)</i></summary>

[Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04434)

**Why it's central**: This is the foundational signSGD convergence+geometry paper (and the majority-vote paper is key if mentioning robustness/communication). It explicitly compares to SignSGD.

**Critical insights**:
- **Most relevant bit**: They already emphasize that **$(\ell_1/\ell_2)$-type geometry of gradients/noise/curvature** matters for sign methods, which is conceptually parallel to the "nuclear/Frobenius ratio" criterion for spectral methods.
- **Caveat**: Many theoretical regimes rely on assumptions (sometimes large-batch or specific noise models) that don't directly map to deterministic smoothness comparison, so avoid overclaiming equivalence.

</details>

### How They Map

- **"SpecGD is steepest descent in spectral norm"**: Carlson'15 + Bernstein/Newhouse'24 + Pethick'25 all reinforce the "non-Euclidean / normed-space optimizer" framing.
- **"SpecGD beats GD when gradients have high effective rank"**: Davis'25 (nuclear rank) and Vasudeva'25 (balanced PC learning) are the two most direct supports.
- **"Rotation invariance vs SignSGD axis-alignment"**: Balles'20 is the cleanest "SignGD needs diagonal-ish geometry" foil.
- **"Muon theory context"**: Shen'25, Kovalev'25, Chen'25 collectively cover convergence, trust-region geometry, and implicit spectral-norm constraint interpretations.

## 🎓 Background: Spectral Bias and Adaptive Optimizers

> Understanding the motivation for spectrum-aware optimizers like Muon.

<details>
<summary><b>Spectral Bias in Practice: the Role of Function Frequency in Generalization</b></summary>

[Paper Link](https://papers.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/306264db5698839230be3642aafc849c-Paper-Conference.pdf)

- **The phenomenon**: Neural networks exhibit frequency-dependent learning rates during gradient descent. For a function $f$ decomposed into Fourier components $f = \sum_k a_k \phi_k$ (where $\phi_k$ are basis functions at frequency $k$), low-frequency components (small $k$) are learned exponentially faster than high-frequency components (large $k$).
- **Theoretical characterization**: Basri et al. (2019) showed that for a component at frequency $\omega$, the learning rate effectively scales as $\mathcal{O}(1/\omega^2)$. This means a 10x higher frequency component learns ~100x slower.
- **Training dynamics**: During optimization, coarse structures (low-frequency) are captured first, while fine-grained details (high-frequency) emerge only later in training or may not be learned at all with limited training time.
- **Benefits**: On balanced data, this spectral bias acts as implicit regularization—promoting smooth functions that resist overfitting to noise, improving generalization.
- **Limitations**: For imbalanced datasets, minority classes or rare features often correspond to high-frequency signals in the data distribution. These are systematically learned slower and may be neglected, leading to poor minority-class performance.
- **Motivation for Muon**: This limitation directly motivates spectrum-aware optimizers like Muon that balance learning across all frequency components rather than privileging low frequencies.

<summary><b>Adam vs. SGD: Achieving Comparable Generalization in Image Classification Through Adaptive Techniques</b></summary>

[Paper Link](https://rjpn.org/ijcspub/viewpaperforall.php?paper=IJCSP25B1033)

- **The generalization gap**: In computer vision tasks (especially ImageNet classification with ResNets), Adam historically achieved 1-3% lower test accuracy than SGD+momentum at similar training loss, despite converging faster.
- **Root cause**: The gap was not fundamental to adaptive methods but due to: (1) lack of decoupled weight decay, and (2) inappropriate scaling across layers.
- **Solution - AdamW**: Decoupling weight decay from gradient-based updates: instead of adding $\lambda w$ to gradient, directly update $w \leftarrow w(1 - \eta\lambda)$ after the adaptive step. This ensures weight decay acts as true L2 regularization regardless of gradient magnitude.
- **Solution - Layer-wise normalization**: Techniques like layer-wise adaptive rate scaling (LARS) or normalization ensure each layer receives appropriate update magnitudes.
- **Result**: With these modifications, AdamW achieves comparable (often identical within error bars) test accuracy to SGD on ImageNet and CIFAR benchmarks.
- **Implication**: The poor generalization of Adam was an artifact of implementation details, not a fundamental limitation of adaptive optimization. This opened the door for spectrum-aware adaptive methods like Muon.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Same Pre-training Loss, Better Downstream: Implicit Bias Matters for Language Models</b></summary>

[Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14199)

- **Core finding**: Models with identical pre-training validation loss can have vastly different downstream task performance. The paper demonstrates this by varying training duration, model size, and optimization method while holding loss constant.
- **Concrete measurement**: An adversarially-trained model (perturbed optimizer) achieved ~6% lower downstream accuracy than a standard AdamW model, despite both having the same pre-training loss. The adversarial model's Hessian trace was ~2x larger.
- **Flatness-performance correlation**: Plotting downstream accuracy vs. Hessian trace (measure of sharpness) across multiple models revealed clear inverse correlation: flatter minima (lower trace) → better downstream performance. The Hessian trace $\text{tr}(H) = \sum_i \lambda_i$ sums eigenvalues of the loss Hessian.
- **Training beyond convergence**: Continuing to train past the point of loss convergence still improved downstream accuracy—implying the solution was becoming flatter/more transferable even though loss didn't change.
- **Mechanism**: Optimizer choice creates implicit bias toward different regions of the loss landscape. Methods like AdamW (with dropout, weight decay) find flatter basins that generalize better to new tasks. Sharper minima memorize training distribution specifics.
- **Relevance to Muon**: Suggests spectrum-aware optimizers like Muon, which have strong implicit regularization (spectral norm constraints), may find flatter solutions that transfer better—a testable hypothesis for future work.

<summary><b>Deconstructing What Makes a Good Optimizer for Language Models</b></summary>

[Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07972)

- **Experimental scope**: Systematic comparison of AdamW, AdaFactor, Lion, and SignSGD on transformer language models up to 1.3B parameters across multiple training scales.
- **Main result - Similar final performance**: When hyperparameters are well-tuned for each optimizer, they reach essentially the same final perplexity and zero-shot downstream accuracy. Differences in final metrics are typically within noise/variance.
- **Plain SGD failure**: Standard SGD (with momentum) fails to train transformers effectively without heavy architectural modifications or extremely careful tuning. Loss either diverges or converges to much worse solutions. This is why adaptive optimizers dominate in NLP.
- **Key differences lie elsewhere**: While final loss is similar, optimizers differ in:
  1. **Hyperparameter robustness**: How sensitive to learning rate, beta values, warmup schedule
  2. **Training efficiency**: How many steps/FLOPs to reach target loss
  3. **Solution characteristics**: Different implicit biases affecting downstream task performance despite same perplexity
- **Implication**: For language models, optimizer choice affects the *nature* of the learned solution and *path* to convergence more than the raw pre-training loss value. This motivates investigating whether spectrum-aware methods like Muon find different (potentially better) solutions for downstream tasks.

<summary><b>Scalable Second Order Optimization for Deep Learning (Shampoo)</b> — <i>Rohan Anil et al. (Google)</i></summary>

[Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09018)

- **The algorithm**: Shampoo preconditions gradients by maintaining two per-layer matrices $L$ and $R$ that approximate the Fisher information or Hessian along row and column dimensions of weight tensors. 
- **Update rule**: 
  $$W \leftarrow W - \eta L^{-1/2} G R^{-1/2}$$
  where $G$ is the gradient, $L = \sum_t G_t G_t^T$, and $R = \sum_t G_t^T G_t$ (with exponential averaging and regularization).
- **Why "whitening"**: This transformation decorrelates the gradient components, making updates isotropic: $\text{Cov}(\text{whitened } G) \approx I$. Treats all directions in weight space equally, unlike raw gradients which can be dominated by a few directions due to ill-conditioning.
- **Computational efficiency**: Key innovation is using Newton-Schulz iteration to compute $M^{-1/2}$ on GPUs: starting from $Z_0 = M / \|M\|$, iterate $Z_{k+1} = \frac{1}{2}Z_k(3I - Z_k^2)$. Converges quadratically without expensive eigendecomposition.
- **Concrete results**: On MLPerf ResNet-50, Shampoo achieved target accuracy with ~20% fewer training steps than SGD and ~41% less total wall-clock time after amortizing computational overhead. Scaled to production systems (e.g., Google Ads CTR prediction) by distributing matrix operations to CPU workers.
- **Connection to Muon**: Muon simplifies Shampoo by removing preconditioner accumulation ($L$ and $R$), directly orthogonalizing the gradient/momentum. This maintains the isotropy benefits with simpler computations and no second-moment storage.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Purifying Shampoo: Investigating Shampoo's Heuristics by Decomposing its Preconditioner</b> — <i>Luke Jasper Latham, Rene Vidal</i></summary>

[Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09627)

- **Decomposition result**: Shows Shampoo's preconditioner $L^{-1/2} G R^{-1/2}$ can be decomposed into two components:
  1. **Spectral normalization**: Normalizes the spectral norm of the gradient (largest singular value → 1)
  2. **Variance adaptation**: Adaptively rescales components based on second-moment statistics (like Adam's per-parameter adaptation)
- **Eigenvalue spread control**: The preconditioner specifically controls the spread of gradient-covariance eigenvalues. If raw gradients have eigenvalues $[\lambda_1, \lambda_2, ..., \lambda_n]$ with $\lambda_1 \gg \lambda_n$ (high condition number), the preconditioner brings them closer together, reducing the condition number of the optimization landscape.
- **Why this helps**: A benign optimization regime with lower condition number means:
  - More stable training (less sensitive to learning rate)
  - Faster convergence (fewer oscillations)
  - Better generalization (less overfitting to high-curvature directions)
- **Relevance to Muon**: Muon inherits Shampoo's spectral normalization component but drops the variance adaptation component. This decomposition helps understand which aspects of matrix-whitening are essential for Muon's benefits.

## 📄 Original Literature

> Foundational papers introducing and deriving Muon

### 🎯 Core Papers

<details>
<summary><b>Muon: An optimizer for hidden layers in neural networks</b> — <i>Keller Jordan (OpenAI)</i></summary>

[Blog Post](https://kellerjordan.github.io/posts/muon/)

**Core algorithm**: Applies momentum, then orthogonalizes the momentum update before stepping. For gradient $G$ with SVD $G = U\Sigma V^T$, Muon replaces it with $\tilde{G} = UV^T$, setting all singular values to 1. This creates an orthonormal update with equal energy in every direction and bounded spectral norm.

**Newton-Schulz orthogonalization**: Efficiently approximates $G(G^T G)^{-1/2}$ through iterative computation:
$$Z_{k+1} = \frac{3}{2}Z_k - \frac{1}{2}Z_k^3$$
starting from $Z_0 = G/\|G\|$. Avoids expensive SVD computation while achieving same effect on accelerators. Converges cubically.

**Hybrid approach**: Uses Muon for all 2D weight matrices (where matrix structure is meaningful), but AdamW for scalar parameters (biases, LayerNorm gains, embedding scaling) and often first/last layers for stability.

**Relationship to prior work**:
- **Shampoo**: Muon simplifies Shampoo by removing preconditioner accumulation, arriving at direct gradient orthogonalization
- **Orthogonal-SGDM**: Muon applies momentum *before* orthogonalization (vs. after) and uses Newton-Schulz (vs. expensive SVD)

**Concrete results**: 
- CIFAR-10: 94% accuracy in 20% less time than previous optimizers
- NanoGPT: Set new records on language modeling speedruns, reaching target validation loss with fewer tokens

**Key design choice**: Decoupled weight decay (like AdamW) applied separately from the orthogonalized update—crucial for proper implicit regularization.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Deriving Muon</b> — <i>Jeremy Bernstein (MIT)</i></summary>

[Blog Post](https://jeremybernste.in/writing/deriving-muon)

**Steepest descent framework**: Shows that many optimizers (including Muon) can be viewed as steepest descent under different norm constraints. The update is: $w_{t+1} = w_t - \eta \cdot \arg\min_{\|\Delta\|_{\mathcal{K}} \leq 1} \langle \nabla f(w_t), \Delta \rangle$, where $\|\cdot\|_{\mathcal{K}}$ is a norm induced by convex function $\mathcal{K}$.

**Lion-K family**: Generalizes the Lion optimizer (Chen et al., 2023) to arbitrary convex functions $\mathcal{K}$. Lion uses $\mathcal{K}(g) = \|g\|_1$ (L1 norm), yielding sign-based updates.

**Muon's position**: Muon corresponds to Lion-K with $\mathcal{K}(G) = \|G\|_*$ (nuclear norm = sum of singular values). The "sign function" in this case becomes the matrix sign function, which for $G = U\Sigma V^T$ is $\text{sign}(G) = UV^T$ —exactly Muon's orthogonalized update.

**Mathematical connection**: For nuclear norm, the proximal operator gives: $\text{prox}_{\mathcal{K}}(G) = G(G^T G)^{-1/2}$, which Muon approximates via Newton-Schulz.

**Implication**: This unifying view shows Muon is principled (not ad-hoc) and opens design space for other matrix-based optimizers by varying $\mathcal{K}$.

## 🧮 Theoretical Analysis

> Convergence properties and optimization-theoretic characterizations of Muon

<details>
<summary><b>On the Convergence Analysis of Muon</b> — <i>Wei Shen et al. (UVA, UBC, Meta, UW-Madison)</i></summary>

[Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23737)

**Main result**: Provides convergence rate analysis comparing Muon against Gradient Descent (GD). Establishes conditions under which Muon outperforms GD.

**When Muon wins**: Shows Muon benefits from two structural properties common in neural networks:
1. **Low-rank Hessians**: When $H \approx \sum_{i=1}^r \lambda_i v_i v_i^T$ with $r \ll d$ (rank $r$ much smaller than dimension $d$)
2. **Approximate block-diagonal structure**: When Hessian is approximately block-diagonal (different parameter groups have weak cross-interactions)

**Convergence rate**: Under smoothness and PL conditions, Muon achieves $\mathcal{O}(1/T)$ convergence rate (same order as GD), but with better constants when above structures hold. The improvement factor scales with the degree of low-rankness and block-diagonality.

**Experimental validation**: Empirical results on neural network training confirm theoretical predictions—Muon's advantage grows with network depth (where these structures become more pronounced).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>A Note on the Convergence of Muon</b> — <i>Jiaxiang Li, Mingyi Hong (University of Minnesota)</i></summary>

[Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02900)

**Alternative perspective**: Provides convergence analysis under different assumptions than the previous paper, potentially covering different problem classes or relaxing certain conditions.

**Complementary techniques**: Uses different proof techniques that may provide tighter bounds in specific regimes or offer insights into different aspects of Muon's behavior.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Muon Optimizes Under Spectral Norm Constraints</b> — <i>Lizhang Chen, Jonathan Li, Qiang Liu (UT Austin)</i></summary>

[Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15054)

**Theoretical framework**: Places Muon within the Lion-K family of optimizers, showing Muon corresponds to Lion-K equipped with the nuclear norm (K is sum of singular values).

**Core result**: Proves that Muon with decoupled weight decay implicitly solves the constrained optimization problem: min f(W) subject to $\|W\|_\sigma \leq C$, where $\|W\|_\sigma$ is the spectral norm (largest singular value) and C is a constant determined by the weight decay coefficient.

**Mechanism**: The orthogonalization step acts as a projection onto the constraint manifold $\{W: \|W\|_\sigma = C\}$, similar to projected gradient descent. Each update doesn't increase the spectral norm—it stays within the spectral norm ball.

**Implications**:
1. Controls model capacity through spectral norm bounds (related to Lipschitz constant)
2. Prevents weight explosion naturally
3. Improves generalization via implicit spectral regularization
4. Opens design space: varying convex function K yields broader class of constrained optimizers

**Empirical validation**: Experiments on ResNet and LLaMA architectures confirm Muon reduces overfitting and maintains robust training dynamics.

<details>
<summary><b>Muon Outperforms Adam in Tail-End Associative Memory Learning</b> — <i>Shuche Wang et al. (NUS, UMN, Sea AI Lab, Yale)</i></summary>

[Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26030)

**Key insight**: Shows Muon enhances isotropy of weight matrices, leading to more balanced knowledge acquisition. Particularly effective at learning tail-end (rare/infrequent) associations in large language models compared to Adam, which tends to prioritize frequent patterns at the expense of rare ones.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How Muon's Spectral Design Benefits Generalization: A Study on Imbalanced Data</b> — <i>Bhavya Vasudeva et al. (USC, UBC)</i></summary>

[Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22980)

**Core finding**: Standard GD learns principal components sequentially (dominant first), while Muon/Shampoo learn all components at similar rates, creating more balanced feature learning.

**Theoretical model**: Introduces idealized Spectral Gradient Descent (SpecGD) that computes $G = U\Sigma V^T$ and updates with $UV^T$ (equalized singular values). Proves in Gaussian-mixture classification with imbalance, GD prioritizes top principal component while SpecGD learns all components simultaneously. Effect amplifies with network depth.

**Concrete improvements**: On vision datasets with class imbalance (e.g., 100:1 ratio), Muon achieved over 5% higher balanced accuracy than AdamW. This gap appears early in training and persists, showing Muon learns minority-class features from the start rather than late in training.

**Why adaptive LR isn't enough**: Giving Adam per-layer adaptive step sizes (normalizing each layer's gradient norm) does NOT eliminate the gap—the advantage is intrinsic to the orthogonalized update direction, not just learning rate magnitude.

**Practical impact**: Provides straightforward way to improve minority-class performance without complex data re-sampling or loss re-weighting schemes. May sacrifice tiny amount of majority-class accuracy but overall test accuracy improves when imbalance is significant.

**TL;DR:** Muon and spectral-type optimizers have an internal bias that automatically pushes them toward solutions that are low-rank and spectrally balanced — even without any explicit regularization.

---

**Problem setting**: Multiclass classification on linearly separable data, where multiple separating hyperplanes exist. The implicit bias question: which separator does each optimizer converge to in the limit of gradient flow?

* When an optimizer runs for a very long time and the training loss goes all the way to zero, what exact classifier (or separating boundary) does it end up with?
*  If multiple different weight matrices can fit the data perfectly, which one does an optimizer like Muon pick, and what does that reveal about its hidden bias?
* What is the implicit geometric bias of spectral-norm optimizers like Muon — and can we rigorously prove which kind of margin or simplicity they maximize?

**Classical result (GD)**: GD on logistic/cross-entropy loss converges to the max-$\ell_2$ margin solution: the separator $w^*$ that maximizes $\min_i \frac{y_i \langle w, x_i \rangle}{\|w\|_2}$ (maximum minimum margin in Euclidean norm).

> **Intuition:** When you train a linear classifier with ordinary gradient descent (say, logistic or cross-entropy loss), the algorithm keeps adjusting the weights to separate the data more confidently. As the loss approaches zero, the direction of the weights stops changing—it converges to one specific separator that maximizes the minimum distance between data points and the decision boundary, measured using the ordinary Euclidean ($L_2$) notion of length. This is why "Gradient descent implicitly finds the $L_2$ max-margin classifier."

**Spectral Descent (and Muon) characterization**: The paper analyzes Spectral Gradient Descent (SpecGD), which orthogonalizes gradients before stepping (equivalent to setting all singular values to 1). For a gradient matrix $G$ with classes along columns, SpecGD uses update direction $\tilde{G} = G(G^T G)^{-1/2}$.

> **Intuition:** Spectral Descent looks at the weight matrix as a geometric object. Before taking a step, it orthogonalizes the gradient, removing scaling differences along different directions and keeping only the shape of the update. Mathematically, that's like replacing the gradient matrix $G$ with $UV^T$, where $G =U \Sigma V$ is its singular-value decomposition. Spectral Descent (and Muon) move in a way that respects the "spectral geometry" — they pay attention to how correlated different classes and features are, not to the raw coordinate values.

**Main theoretical result**: Shows that spectral methods (including Muon) converge to a different implicit bias than standard GD. Rather than maximizing margin in $\ell_2$ norm, they implicitly optimize a margin criterion that accounts for the spectral structure of the data.

> All of this means Muon and Spectral Descent don't just optimize faster — they're actually aiming for a different kind of simplicity. Instead of minimizing "overall size" of the weights (like Euclidean norm), they minimize the "strongest directional power" of the matrix (its spectral norm).

**Multiclass specifics**: In the multiclass setting with $K$ classes, the solution space is $\mathbb{R}^{d \times K}$ (weight matrix $W$ with one column per class). The paper characterizes:

1. **Direction of convergence**: What directional properties the limit $W^* / \|W^*\|$ satisfies
2. **Margin type**: What notion of margin is implicitly maximized (spectral norm-based vs. Frobenius norm-based vs. nuclear norm-based)
3. **Class balance**: How the method treats different classes (balanced vs. biased toward majority)

**Comparison to GD**: Key differences in the implicit bias:
- **GD**: Converges to max-$\ell_2$ margin, can be biased toward majority classes
- **Spectral methods (Muon/SpecGD)**: More balanced treatment of classes due to orthogonalization equalizing contribution from each class's gradient. The margin criterion involves spectral norm $\|W\|_{\sigma} = \sigma_{\max}(W)$ rather than Frobenius norm.

**Experimental results:**

The x-axis = number of training iterations. The y-axis = how close the model's current margin is to the maximum possible margin under different norms.

| Panel | Optimizer | Which margin increases the most? | Meaning |
|:------|:-----------|:--------------------------------|:---------|
| (a) SignGD | Max-norm (blue) | The blue curve rises and dominates | SignGD naturally prefers the **$L_\infty$ margin** — consistent with its $L_\infty$ geometry. |
| (b) NGD | $L_2$ (orange) | The orange curve rises and dominates | Gradient descent converges to the **$L_2$ max-margin separator** — the classical result. |
| (c) Spectral-GD | Spectral (green) | The green curve rises highest | Spectral Descent converges to the **spectral-norm margin** — i.e., the smallest dominant singular value. |
| (d) Muon | Spectral (green) | Same as Spectral-GD | Muon behaves just like Spectral Descent — it maximizes the **spectral margin**. |

**Practical implications**: 
1. On imbalanced multiclass data, Muon's implicit bias leads to better minority-class separation
2. The solution is more "democratic" across classes—no single class dominates the parameter updates
3. Connects to the imbalanced data results: the implicit bias explains *why* Muon learns minority classes better

**Connection to max-margin theory**: Extends classical results on implicit bias of GD (Soudry et al., 2018) to spectral/matrix-structured optimizers, providing theoretical foundation for understanding Muon's behavior on classification tasks.

<summary><b>Muon Optimizer Accelerates Grokking</b> — <i>Amund Tveit et al. (Microsoft Norway)</i></summary>

[Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16041)

**What is grokking**: A phenomenon where models exhibit sudden delayed generalization—continuing to train past zero training loss eventually leads to dramatic improvement in test accuracy.

**Experimental setup**: Seven numerical tasks using modern Transformer architecture, systematically varying optimizer (Muon vs. AdamW) and softmax activation function variants.

**Concrete results**: Muon reduced mean grokking epoch from 153.09 to 102.89 across all configurations—a statistically significant 33% reduction (t = 5.0175, p = 6.33e-08). This demonstrates Muon's spectral norm constraints and second-order information facilitate faster transition from memorization to true generalization.

**Why it matters**: Suggests that optimizer choice fundamentally affects learning dynamics beyond just convergence speed, influencing when and how models develop genuine understanding vs. mere pattern memorization.
